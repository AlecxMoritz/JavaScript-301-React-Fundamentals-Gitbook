# Common Errors
Here are some common errors that we see with React. 

Did you save the file after changing?
Do you have an import statement for the component?
Is everything in the return wrapped in one element?
className is used, it's not class.
Does the component have an export statement somewhere?
Does the class component extend { Component }?
Are putting that non-component, like routes, in there without { }?
Are you trying to put your components inside {}?
