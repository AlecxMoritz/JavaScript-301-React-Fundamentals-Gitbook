## JSX Translated

So what is going on under that component?

So here is that exact same element written in JSX format:

```js

import React from 'react';
import BabelImage from '../../assets/jsx-babel.PNG';

const JSXRules = () => {
	return React.createElement(
		'div',
		{ className: 'main' },
		React.createElement(
			'div',
			{ className: 'mainDiv' },
			React.createElement(
				'h1',
				{ className: 'section-title' },
				'JSX'
			),
			React.createElement(
				'dl',
				null,
				React.createElement(
					'dt',
					null,
					'Resembles HTML'
				),
				React.createElement(
					'dd',
					null,
					'It\'s not. It\'s actually closer to JavaScript.'
				),
				React.createElement(
					'dt',
					null,
					'"React elements"'
				),
				React.createElement(
					'dd',
					null,
					'These are used to construct and update the DOM, or what you see on the screen.'
				),
				React.createElement(
					'dt',
					null,
					'Not required'
				),
				React.createElement(
					'dd',
					null,
					'You can write in Vanilla JS, but most sane people use JSX.'
				)
			),
			React.createElement('hr', null),
			React.createElement(
				'h1',
				null,
				'Example'
			),
			React.createElement(JSXTranslation, null)
		)
	);
};

export default JSXRules;
```

This is 3x as many lines, and is not the driest code. However, it's important to know that under the hood, we are given a few important rules because of this:

### Use className
RULE: `className` is used for CSS class purposes instead of class. Why is this? In ES6 JavaScript introduced classes. This means that `class` is a keyword in JavaScript, and it has an entirely different meaning. Hence, `className` is used to target CSS.


### babeljs.io
Something great to do. Go to Babeljs.io and paste a component into their repl window:

http://babeljs.io/repl/

You'll get a good glimpse of what your component would look like in Vanilla JS. This in itself is a strong exercise in reading JavaScript.
