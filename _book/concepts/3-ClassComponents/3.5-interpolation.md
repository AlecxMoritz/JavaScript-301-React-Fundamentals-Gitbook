```js
//Interpolation
const username = 'Kenn';

console.log(`${username} is the true JS Wizard!`);

//Note the backticks, allow us to do template literal - more than one line, handy with HTML.
console.log(`Hey students,
What bugs can
${username}
fix 
for you today`);

//Interpolation with an object, very common to see in React
const person = {
    username: 'Kenn',
    profession: 'Secret Agent'
}

console.log(`${person.username}, ${person.profession}`, 'extraordinaire');

```
