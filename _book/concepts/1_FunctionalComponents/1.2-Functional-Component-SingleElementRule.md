### Major Rule: A single element
One of the first rules you need to know about any component, whether it be functional or class, is that all JSX code must be wrapped inside a single element, a `<div>`, an `<h1>`, or inside of any other element with a closing tag. Let's look at again now. Notice that you have done this in your  FunctionalComponentDemo with the Hello React text wrapped in the opening and closing <div> tags:

```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
 +       <div>
 +           Hello React
 +       </div>
    );
};
```

Compare that code to the following:
```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
 +       <div>
 +           Hello, React!
 +       </div>
 +       <div>
 +           How are you today?
 +       </div>
    );
};
```

What's different? The second one will throw an error because it is not wrapped in a single element. Both of the divs are on the same level in the DOM tree. There has to be a single parent in the return. 

#### Run the error
We highly encourage you to run the code with the error, so that you can see what the error tells you. Starting out, you will do it all the time, and the sooner you learn, the better. Remember the error.

#### Making it work
If we did want to use the second example, we would want it to look like this:

```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
 +       <div>
 +         <div>
 +           Hello, React!
 +         </div>
 +         <div>
 +           How are you today?
 +         </div>
 +       </div>   
    );
};
```

Go ahead and run the app. You'll see it run now.


### Challenge 

Before moving on, see if you can write the above component with Arrow Function syntax. It's very common to see in React components. If you aren't sure, try to research it or simply just move on to the answer in the next module. 

You can find information about Arrow Functions at the (MDN)
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions].
