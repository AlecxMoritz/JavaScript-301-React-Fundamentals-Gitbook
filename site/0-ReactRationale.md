# React Intro
###What is it?
React is a JavaScript library. Much like jQuerym it is a single file, created and maintained by Facebook. It is component-based, which means that you can use Components to describe your desired outcome for very specific areas on the webpage. For instance, we might have a component for nav, footer, main, counter, etc. 

###Rationale
As of today React is one of the top 3 tools for using JavaScript on the front end. Because of its speed, quick learning curve, reusability of components, and performance, React is enormously popular.
