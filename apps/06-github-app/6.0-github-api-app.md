#Github Api App

Much respect must be sent to Samer Buna for this awesome starter app using the Github Api.

We'll play around with the Github API in this application. Let's get started. 

For now, we're going to give you the files. It's up to you to make it work together. Make the files, make the connections, play around with the API. You have the jigsaw pieces, put them in place.
