# YouTube Api

All thanks, up front, to Stephen Grider for the core functionality of this app: the Youtube Search and the `YTSearch` npm package. If you want to check out an amazing React course, check out any one of his courses on Udemy. He often has his work on sale, and he is an incredible instructor. TODO: add UDEMY link here.



Here we use the raw part of the application and play around with it in a few different ways to see the kind of data that you can pull off from the Youtube api. 

Have fun!!!
