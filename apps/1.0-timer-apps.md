Before we start on our first timer app, we first need to add a folder for this app to our files. Underneath our apps folder, create a new folder called "timer-apps".

```
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── apps
                    └── timer-apps
       
```

Inside of our timer-apps folder, we're going to create our components for this timer application. The first component we will make will be the parent component for this app, like App.js is for our overall React application. Create a file called "TimePiecesApp.js" inside our timer-apps folder. Ensure, like always, that this is capitalized, as it is a react component.  

```
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── apps
                    └── timer-apps
                        └── TimePiecesApp.js
       
```

In this application, we're going to learn more 


```js
import React from 'react';
import TimerApp from './TimerApp';
import ClockApp from './ClockApp';
//TODO: Add a StopWatchApp

//Child
const TimePiecesApp = function () {
    return (
        <div className="main">
            <div className="mainDiv">
                <TimerApp />
                <hr />
                <ClockApp />
                <hr />
                <h1>StopWatch App</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}

export default TimePiecesApp;

```
