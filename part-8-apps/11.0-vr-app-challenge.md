# 11.0 - VR App Challenge

Surprisingly, you can write a Virtual Reality component with about 60 lines of code.

For instance, the following [demo](http://ngokevin.github.io/aframe-react-boilerplate/) was built with this [component](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react-boilerplate/blob/master/src/index.js).

## Challenge:

Objective: _We'd like you to try your hand at building a small component using the_ `aframe-react` _package. Notice that this package is already added into the_ `package.json` _file._

## Helpful Tutorials & Sites

Feel free to build something from an existing tutorial or application. [Here's](https://www.viget.com/articles/creating-your-first-webvr-app/) a tutorial on how to build something similar.

React.rocks also has a number of applications that you could use to get started.

Just so you know, it is possible to do more things than just video games or entertainment. For instance, have a look at this [application](http://www.360syria.com) about the situation in Syria.

If you find this enjoyable, it might be something you can use or include in your capstone project.
