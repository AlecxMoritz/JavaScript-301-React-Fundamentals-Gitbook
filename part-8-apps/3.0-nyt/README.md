# 3.0 - NYT

## What We're Going to Build & Learn

* The NYT App we did in Vanilla JS in React
* We're going to learn parallels between vanilla JS and React, and some advantages that React has

## Getting Started

Before we start on our New York Times App, we first need to add a folder for this app to our files. Underneath our apps folder, create a new folder called "nyt-app".

```text
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── apps
                    └── nyt-app
```

Inside of our nyt-app folder, we're going to create our components for this NYT application. The first component we will make will be the parent component for this app, like App.js is for our overall React application. Create a file called "NytApp.js" inside our nyt-app folder. Ensure, like always, that this is capitalized, as it is a react component.

```text
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── apps
                    └── nyt-app
                        └── NytApp.js
```

Next, we'll start building our main component for this little app.
