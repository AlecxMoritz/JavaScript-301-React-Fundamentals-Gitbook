# Props 
Let's get started with props by adding a single prop to a Class Component called `PropsDemo`. We'll use this component as our base component through these modules. Here you will start to get a cursory understanding of props in React. 

### Class Components w/ props

Let's do a few steps so that we can play around:
1. In the `components/concepts` folder create a new file called `PropsDemo.js`. 
2. Let's import react in the file.  

```js
import React from 'react';
```

3. In your terminal let's add a package called 'prop-types'. This package is going to allow us to set some defaults for our props. More on this later. Just install for now by running the following:

 `npm install prop-types --save` 
 
4. After running that, you should see this added to your `package.json` file. 
5. Add the import for that package in the `PropsDemo.js`: 

```js
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
```

6. Inside the file let's set up a regular class component called `PropsDemo.js`. It will look like this with the export already attached:

```js
export default class PropsDemo extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="main">
                <div className="mainDiv">


                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

```

7. Next, add the following code inside of an `h1` tag:
```js
export default class PropsDemo extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="main">
                <div className="mainDiv">

                    <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>

                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

```


8. Below the closing curly braces of the class, add the following code: 

```js
PropsDemo.propTypes = {
    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}

PropsDemo.defaultProps = {
    title: 'Hello Props'
}
```

9. Let's get this component firing in the route. Go to `routes.js` and add the following import:

```js
    import PropsDemo from '../concepts/PropsDemo';
```

10. Add a route for the `PropsDemo` component to fire called `routes.js`: 

```js
    {
      path: '/propsdemo',
      exact: true,
      main: () => <PropsDemo />
    },
```

### Sidebar
Let's also add the sidebar link:

```js
        <li><Link to="/propsdemo">Props Demo</Link></li>
```

### Default Value

Now we can start to play around with our first custom prop(You've used them before).
Go ahead and run the app. You should see the following:

![Default-props](../../assets/4.1.1_props_first.PNG)


This is showing the default prop. Right? 

Now, let's go ahead and add a new value for our prop.  We add a value for our property much like we would an HTML property. Think of an HTML attribute property:


```html
<h1 class="some-foo-attribute-here">
```

Keep that concept in mind as you use props in React. See if you can do that with our component. Get it to show 'Allison's Creature Project' instead of the default title, like this:

![Custom Value](../../assets/4.1.2_props_custom_value.PNG)


### Custom Value

The answer is to go into the `route.js` file and add a value to the component where it is called:

```js
    {
      path: '/propsdemo',
      exact: true,
      main: () => <PropsDemo title="Allison's Creature Project" />
    },
```

### Reflection

Let's reflect a little on what's happening. In the component, when we say `this.props.title`, we give ourselves the ability to add a `title` attribute in the props. We have the handy defaultProps that sets the value:

```js 
PropsDemo.defaultProps = {
    title: 'Hello Props'
}
```

We also make it required to have a `title` property on `PropsDemo`:
```js
PropsDemo.propTypes = {
    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}
```

### A couple questions
Then, there is the interpolation that we're doing in the JSX:

```js
<h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
```

So this raises some questions:
1. Why are we using `this`? 
2. How does the class know about `title`?
3. How does PropsDemo know about props?
4. What the heck is going on?


1. Remember back to our discussion of classes in ES6. The `this` keyword is part of our class, and it will refer to <ital>this</ital> instance of the component. To illustrate this, lets take an experimental approach. Go to `_routes.js`. Add another instance of the component:

```js
    {
      path: '/propsdemo',
      exact: true,
      main: () => <div>
                    <PropsDemo title="Allison's Creature App"/>
                    <PropsDemo title="Adam's Creature App"/>
                </div>
    },
```
You should get this:

![Custom Value](../../assets/4.1.1_this.PNG)


We now have two instances of the component. Each component has a separate value for the title property. So, think of it like this: when *this.props.title* gets called, it asks: "What is the title value of *this* instance of the component?"  

Thinking this way, will start to help you wrap your head around the `this` keyword.

2. With the first question, `props` are baked into React itself. You don't need to do this, but if you were to go into your node_modules and find the `React.js` file, you'll find `props` in there. Same with state.  We'll cover a little more as we get into our class constructor in the `super()` method. For now, know that `props` are found in the React code itself.

3. We imported the `prop-types` package, which allows us to set `defaultProps` and set `isRequired` properties.  Our class name is `PropsDemo`, meaning that when we say `PropsDemo.propTypes`, we are accessing that `title` property and tethering it to the class above. Think of the `default` as the parent of the PropsDemo class, and it is passing a prop down to PropsDemo. This passing down of props is something you'll hear continuously as you explore React. We'll get into that next.
