# Props Challenge

Here is a short challenge to allow you to practice using props. A possible answer is on the next page. Try not to move ahead unless you are extremely stuck.

Using the same Class Component, we need to add three more simple props to our component: 
* author
* codepenUrl
* description

Make it so that all three of these are required properties, and set default properties for all of them. 

Please call four instances of the component with the following alphabetical data(participants correct our titles please):

    title: Beast Creature
    author: Adam Smith
    codepenUrl: https://codepen.io/Adamws33/pen/KZQxwJ
    date: 01/15/2018

    title: Celtic Beast
    author: Allison Summers
    codepenUrl: https://codepen.io/alsummers/pen/jYzyZZ
    date: 01/15/2018

    title: Beast from Caracas
    author: Andres(Dre) Martin
    codepenUrl: https://codepen.io/dreMartin/pen/eyVLGN
    date: 01/15/2018

    title: Beast Mode
    author: Andrew Gunst
    codepenUrl: https://codepen.io/agunst99/pen/RxMYOM
    date: 01/15/2018
     
Here's what you should have by the end. Don't worry about styling for now.
