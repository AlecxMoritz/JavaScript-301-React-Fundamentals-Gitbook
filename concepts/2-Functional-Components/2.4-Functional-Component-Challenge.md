# Functional Component Challenge

Here's your challenge: Using `dl`, `dt`, and `dd` tags, refactor your FCDemo Component so that it shows a list of notes about Functional Components. See the following image for an example of what your finished product should look like. There are many ways to refactor to achieve this result. If you are unfamiliar with these tags, you will have to research how to use them.

### More Challenges
If you easily handle that, here are a few more thoughts for exploration. There is some freedom here: 

* Add more content about Functional Components in general.
* Do some original styling.
* Make usage of the reactstrap library that we've imported.
* Figure out how to use the codepen npm package that we've added by embedding a Codepen in your view. This anticipates a future lesson on 'props'. 
* You are free to make this tutorial site however you would like it to look.
* There is no 'right' answer to this part of the challenge.
