### Unmount Phase Method

### componentWillUnmount() ***
`componentWillUnmount()` is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in `componentDidMount()`. If we don't take the time to remove events we can create memory leaks in our system or leave bad references laying around. React will often do a good job of telling you that you're trying to update something that is no longer mounted if you forget to do this, so if you see this message make sure you've cleaned up everything in `componentWillUnmount()` for your components.
