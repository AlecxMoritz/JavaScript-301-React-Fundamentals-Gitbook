#Functional Components

Hopefully, you notice that we had separate files for header, footer, main, sidebar, etc. These are all known as components. React has two major types of components. Functional Components and Class Components.  Components are individual pieces of the UI that can be altered independent of one another. In this module we'll start by talking about Functional Components.

### Functional Components
Here are a few bullet points about functional components:

* Functional components allow you to render information to the web page without having to use or change state.
* Functional components are known as presentation components.  
* Often used for simply rendering a small chunk of code to the dom.
* No 'this' keyword 
* Unlike class components, functional ones don't use 'this'. 
* Don't worry about changing state with these.
* These are dumb components for UI. 

### Directory Setup
Let's set up a concepts folder and a .js file: 

```
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
         +      └── concepts
         +            └── FunctionalComponentDemo.js
                └── site
```

### Functional Component Example

Let's create a simple functional component, eventually we'll make one that lists the rules above.  Go into the FunciontalComponentDemo file add the following code. At this point you probably want to start typing stuff in so that you can get a good feel for the React keystrokes and syntax.

```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
        
    );
};
```

If you were to run the app at this point, you would receive an error. A functional component should return something. Also, we need to call the component. We'll talk about that in a moment.

RULE: One major rule of a component is that all code must be wrapped inside a single element, a `<div>`, an `<h1>`, or inside of any other element with a closing tag. Let's set that up now. Add the following code to your FunctionalComponentDemo:


```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
 +       <div>
 +           Hello React
 +       </div>
    );
};
```

### Calling a Component
A Functional Component is essentially a function, so like a function, we need to call the function to use it. Most of the time, when you call an instance of a component, it will be called similarly to an HTML self-closing tag, and the call will be the same name as the component itself. So for instance, this component is called FunctionalComponentDemo, so we'll call it like this

`<FunctionalComponentDemo />`

To call this, we'll need to have it in our `routes.js` file:
```js
export const routes = [
    {
      path: '/' || '/home',
      exact: true,
      sidebar: () => <div>Home</div>,
      main: () => <Home />
    },
    {
      path: '/functionalcomponent',
      exact: true,
      sidebar: () => <div>Functional Component</div>,
      main: () => <FunctionalComponentDemo />
    }
```
Point: When a user goes to the '/functionalcomponent' path or clicks the phrase in the sidebar, it will fire off the component in our main area. React Router is helping here. More on that later. 

When you run the app, it should look like this:
![hello-react](./assets/4-components-hello-react.PNG)

### Expanding the Component
Let's add more content to the component.

```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
        <div className="main">
            <div className="mainDiv">
                <h1>Functional Component</h1>
                <p>Functional components allow you to render information to the web page without
				having to use or change state.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Presentational </dt>
                    <dd>Often used for simply rendering a small chunk of code to the dom.</dd>
                    <dt>No 'this' keyword </dt>
                    <dd>Unlike class components, functional ones don't use 'this'.</dd>
                    <dt>No state</dt>
                    <dd>These are 'dumb' components for UI.</dd>
                    <dt>return()</dt>
                    <dd>Must return a single element.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h1>Functional Syntax versus Arrow Function</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};

export default FunctionalComponentDemo;
```

Rerun the app. It should like this:

![hello-react](./assets/4-components-functionalrules.PNG)


### Fat Arrow Challenge
It is very common to see the Fat Arrow/Arrow Function syntax be used with React, especially in Functional Components. The Fat Arrow provides a more terse and compact approach to writing a function. It's important to note that the Fat Arrow is part of ES6, plain old JS. You can write plain JavaScript with React. 

As a challenge write a Component using the Fat Arrow syntax. Use the following guidelines to guide you:
1. In the same file and underneath the export statement, create a Functional component called HelloReactArrow.
2. Call the function inside the FunctionalDemoComponent. It must be located somewhere inside the main divs.  
3. Here's what you should have after finishing this challenge.
