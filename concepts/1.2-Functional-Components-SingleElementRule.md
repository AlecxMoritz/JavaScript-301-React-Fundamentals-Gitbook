### Major Rule: A single element
One of the first rules you need to know about any component, whether it be functional or class, is that all JSX code must be wrapped inside a single element, a `<div>`, an `<h1>`, or inside of any other element with a closing tag. Let's set that up now. Add the following code to your FunctionalComponentDemo:


```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
 +       <div>
 +           Hello React
 +       </div>
    );
};
```

Compare that code to the following:
```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
 +       <div>
 +           Hello, React!
 +       </div>
 +       <div>
 +           How are you today?
 +       </div>
    );
};
```

The second one will throw an error because it is not wrapped in a single element. Both of the divs are on the same node level in the DOM tree. 

#### Run the error
We highly encourage you to run the code with the error, so that you can see what the error tells you. What is the feedback? We think that you'll find that it is excellent. What is the error? Remember it, the sooner you learn to wrap everything in one div, the better off you'll be.

#### Making it work
If we wanted to wrap all this together, we could do it like this:

```js
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponentDemo = function () {
    return (
 +       <div>
 +         <div>
 +           Hello, React!
 +         </div>
 +         <div>
 +           How are you today?
 +         </div>
 +       </div>   
    );
};
```
