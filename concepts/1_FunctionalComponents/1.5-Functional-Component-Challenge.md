###Final Challenge

There is some freedom here. What you should do is take some time to get the Functional Component looking somewhat sharper. 

* Add more content about Functional Components in general.
* Do some styling.
* Make usage of the reactstrap library that we've imported.
* Figure out how to use the codepen npm package that we've added. This anticipates a future lesson props. Embed a Codepen in the Functional Component view. 
* You are free to make your tutorial site however you can....
