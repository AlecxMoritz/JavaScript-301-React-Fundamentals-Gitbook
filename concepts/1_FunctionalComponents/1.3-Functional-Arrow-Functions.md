# Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are all over the place in React. It's important for you to know how they work.  

Again, we recommend taking a (read)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions] through the documentation. Some of the points below are cherry picked from there, and there are some points, like the 'this' keyword, that we'll have to review later.

Have a look at this example. Just for context, ot's Vanilla JS:

```js
var add = function(x, y){
    return x + y;
}
```

Take a look at that same function written with arrow function. 
```js
var add = (x, y) => x + y;
```
Notice in the above code, we don't have to use the 'return' keyword. It's implicitly added when there is one line/expression in the body of the function. 


Let's see another example, same thing straight from the MDN docs.
```js
var func = x => x * x;                  
// concise body syntax, implied "return"

var func = (x, y) => { return x + y; }; 
// with block body, explicit "return" needed
```

With writing Arrow Functions, we can omit the return keyword, or we can say it. Consider the following example where the first and second version of the function are the same.

```js
let greetUser = username => `Hello, ${username}!`;
let greetUserSecondVersion = username => { return `Hello ${username}!` };
console.log(greetUser('Kenn') === greetUserSecondVersion('Kenn')); // true
```

### Another Fat Arrow Challenge
It is very common to see the Fat Arrow/Arrow Function syntax used with React, especially in Functional Components. The Fat Arrow provides a more terse and compact approach to writing a function. It's important to note that the Fat Arrow is part of ES6, plain old JS. You can write plain JavaScript with React. 

Before moving on, see if you can write the above component with Arrow Function syntax. It's very common to see in React components. If you aren't sure, try to research it or simply just move on to the answer in the next module. 

You can find information about Arrow Functions at the (MDN)
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions]. 
As a challenge write a Component using the Fat Arrow syntax. Use the following guidelines to guide you:
1. In the same file and underneath the export statement, create a Functional component called HelloReactArrow.
2. Call the function inside the FunctionalDemoComponent. It must be located somewhere inside the main divs.  
3. Here's what you should have after finishing this challenge.
