# Calling a Component
A Functional Component is essentially a function, so like a function, we need to call the function to use it. Most of the time, when you call an instance of a component, it will be called similarly to an HTML self-closing tag, and the call should generally be the same name as the component itself. So for instance, this component is called FunctionalComponentDemo, so we'll call it like this

`<FunctionalComponentDemo />`

### Where to call it?
Let's play around a little bit with our `App.js`.  Go into the file and do the following:

1. Add an import for the Functional COmponent file. 
2. Remove the items inside the tags currently inside the <div>
3. Add the call of the component <FunctionalComponentDemo. 

```js

*****************************
Some Imports omitted
*****************************
import FunctionalComponentDemo from './components/concepts/1.0_FunctionalComponentDemo.js';
import Sidebar from './components/site/Sidebar'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <FunctionalComponentDemo />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

One more quick change:
1. In the scss files, go to `_body.scss`.
2. Change color: white to `color: $red`(just so we can see our text)

```css
/****************************
Body Section
****************************/
body {
    padding: 15px;
    color: $red;
    font: Belleza;
}
```
Run `npm start`. You should see the following:

![functional-component](../assets/1.0-FunctionalComponent-Demo.PNG)

## Quick Explanation

So what's happening here? We have the FCDemo component. It's being called in App.js. App.js is being called inside of index.js. index.js is reaching out to the root in the index.html file. 
Rule: Data flows in one direction in React. 
TODO: Insert diagram. 


When you run the app, it should look like this:
![hello-react](../assets/4-components-hello-react.PNG)


Let's take the app back to where it was. You'll need to change the `App.js` file and the `_body.scss` file back by hitting `ctrl + z`. It should do it even if you haven't saved. 


#### Where to really call it
With our set up, to get the component firing properly we need to call the components in our `_routes.js` file. 

Here's how this works, 
So first of all, let's return each of the files to the original state and bring the app back.
In our application we'll need to call it in our routes.  To call this, we'll need to have it in our `routes.js` file:
```js
export const routes = [
    {
      path: '/' || '/home',
      exact: true,
      sidebar: () => <div>Home</div>,
      main: () => <Home />
    },
    {
      path: '/functionalcomponent',
      exact: true,
      sidebar: () => <div>Functional Component</div>,
      main: () => <FunctionalComponentDemo />
    }
```
Point: When a user goes to the '/functionalcomponent' path or clicks the phrase in the sidebar, it will fire off the component in our main area. React Router is helping here. More on that later.
