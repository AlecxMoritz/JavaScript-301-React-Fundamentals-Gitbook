## The Dual State Challenge

Part 1: See if you can add a dislike button that is independent of the like button and has it's own counter that goes into negative numbers.


Part 2: Use the react-icons npm package that is already installed to create icons in the app.
At the end it would look like this....

### Class Components

Class Components have a little more complexity than Functional Components. Let's stay with our pattern and make a little list of notes here. 

* Must extend React.Component.

* Must always have a render method.

* Will often have a `constructor`.

* Class components are considered the "React way" of writing components.
        
* Known as intelligent components.

* Built with ES6 JS Classes.
            
* Have lifecycle hooks/methods, different phases in the lifecycle of the component where different events can/should happen. 

* Use export, like Functional Components.

* Multiple class components can be in one file, but only one class component should be exported for each file.

These are a few rules that we'll study in the upcoming modules.
