# Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are all over the place in React. It's important for you to know how they work.  

First of all, we recommend taking a (read)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions] through the documentation. Some of the points below are cherry picked from there. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions


```js
var add = function(x, y){
    return x + y;
}
```

```js
var add = (x, y) => x + y;
```
Notice in the above code, we don't have to use the 'return' keyword. It's implicityl

Another example, same thing from the MDN docs.
```js
var func = x => x * x;                  
// concise body syntax, implied "return"

var func = (x, y) => { return x + y; }; 
// with block body, explicit "return" needed
```


```js
let greetUser = username => `Hello, ${username}!`;
let greetUserSecondVersion = username => { return `Hello ${username}!` };
console.log(greetUser('Kenn') === greetUserSecondVersion('Kenn')); // true
```





### Fat Arrow Challenge
It is very common to see the Fat Arrow/Arrow Function syntax used with React, especially in Functional Components. The Fat Arrow provides a more terse and compact approach to writing a function. It's important to note that the Fat Arrow is part of ES6, plain old JS. You can write plain JavaScript with React. 

As a challenge write a Component using the Fat Arrow syntax. Use the following guidelines to guide you:
1. In the same file and underneath the export statement, create a Functional component called HelloReactArrow.
2. Call the function inside the FunctionalDemoComponent. It must be located somewhere inside the main divs.  
3. Here's what you should have after finishing this challenge.
