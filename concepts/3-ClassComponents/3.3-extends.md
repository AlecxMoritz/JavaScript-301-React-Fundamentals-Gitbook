# Extends and Prototypal Inheritance

It looks daunting, but it will not take a long time to read. Please go read the mdn docs about [Prototye Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

It's important to start familiarizing yourself with this idea of inheritance in JavaScript. Even though JavaScript is different than other languages with its inheritance, we'll talk in a somewhat classical sense so that you can get an idea of what inheritance is on a fundamental level.

Let's consider the class:

```js
//ES6 JS Classes
class User {
    constructor(name){
      this.name = name;
      this.type = "Trial User"
    }
    //Method 1
    greet(){
      console.log('Welcome back,' + this.name);
    }
    //Method 2
    status(){
      console.log('Current status: ' + this.type);
    }
  }
  
//Extends
class TrialUser extends User {
    trialEnding(){
      console.log('Your trial will be ending soon, ' + this.name + '.' + ' Would you like to join our program?');
    }
  }
```

So, when we use the `extends` keyword, we are doing something that we call subclassing. This means that the `TrialUser` class becomes a child of `User`, and therefore inherits all of its functions and properties. 

You should also note that `TrialUser` has a `trialEnding` method, something that User won't have. 

Let's test this out by making some objects:


```js  
//Instance of User class
  var anonDude = new User("Anonymous");
  anonDude.greet();
  anonDude.status();

//Instance of TrialUser class
  var trialUser = new TrialUser("Paul");
  trialUser.greet();
  trialUser.trialEnding();
  trialUser.status();

```

This is called inheritance. We use `extends` to indicate that we are creating a new class that will inherit the properties and functions of another class and take on properties of its own. Fairly simple concept.
