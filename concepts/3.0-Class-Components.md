#Class Components
Class components add a bit more complexity to our React app. 
### Class Components
* Have a mutable state in the application.
* Class components are considered the "React way" of writing components.  
* Extends React.Component. 
* You can write this as either "extends React.Component" or "extends Component" with Component being imported in from react at the top of your code.
* Must always have a render() method.

### Directory Setup
Let's set up a few files for the next Section. 

```
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── concepts
                      └── ClassComponentDemo.js
                      └── FunctionalComponentDemo.js
                └── site
```

### Class Component Example

In the components folder, create a file called HelloWorld.js.

Add the following code to the file: 

```js
import React from 'react';
import {Component} from 'react';

export default class HelloWorld extends Component {
  render(){
    return(
      <div>Hello World</div>
    );
  }
}
```
### render(){}
In a class component, you must have the following items in every method:

```js 
render(){
  return(

  )
}
``` 

### Create instance of the component:
