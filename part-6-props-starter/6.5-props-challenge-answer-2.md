# 6.5: Props Challenge Answer \#2

Here is the entire file for breaking each section out into separate components with an individual prop for each component. Notice that all of them follow the same pattern:

One important concept is to start thinking about how props get 'passed down' from parent to child component. In this case the parent component is the `PropsDemo` component, and the child components are `Title`, `Author`, `CodepenUrl`, and `Footer`. The child components are being called here in the parent, and the prop data is being passed into the child components.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

export default class PropsDemo extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="main">
                <div className="mainDiv">
                    <Title title="Celtic CSS Gods" />
                    <Author author="Allison Summers" />
                    <CodepenUrl codepenUrl="www.codepen.io" />
                    <Footer date="2/15/18" /> 
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

The next thing that happens is the values get 'passed down' to each of the Child Components to be rendered. It's for this reason that many people say that props just render the data and are involved in rendering data for 'dumb' components. All four of these components are child components of the `PropsDemo`, and they are waiting to receive data from the data source. They do not know anything about the source. They just wait for directions and then render when called:

```javascript
class Title extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <h3>
                {this.props.title}
            </h3>
        );
    }
}

class Author extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <h3>
                <p>{this.props.author}</p>
            </h3>
        );
    }
}

class CodepenUrl extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <h3>
                {this.props.codepenUrl}
            </h3>
        );
    }
}

class Footer extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <h3>
                {this.props.date}
            </h3>
        );
    }
}

//Defaults
PropsDemo.propTypes = {
    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    author: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    codepenUrl: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    date: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}

PropsDemo.defaultProps = {
    title: 'Generic Creature project',
    author: 'EFA Student',
    codepenUrl: 'www.codepen.com',
    date: '01/01/2018'
}
```
