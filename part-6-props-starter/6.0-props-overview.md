# 6.0: Props Overview

So, if you go study props in React, you'll often read that 'props' are simple. They are just 'properties'. While this is true, we find that it's not always so simple to initially learn. Let's see if we can get you some straight ahead understanding of working with props in React.

* not the same as state
* are received from above from a 'parent' component
* are immutable
* are properties, a way to confgure a component
* can think of them like parameters to a function

These are just some starter rules to be aware of. Let's get started on messing around with props. Like everything else, this is a primer, just to get your feet wet.
