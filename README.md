# React Fundamentals Version 3.0

### Introduction

Think of this as your starting guidebook to React. Here's where we'll be going:

1. Clone our starter application, if you haven't already. 
2. In Part 1: we'll discuss one way to start a React application. We'll walk through the starter application together. You'll have it for when you start your own application. 
3. In Part 2: We'll start by covering the basics of React, moving into apps to help you reinforce important topics, finish up on your main project, and also include tons of helpful resources for you to continue learning.

### A few notes:

In the first few modules, we'll be setting up a few things just to get started. The first modules will be a sort of blind code-along. You can refer back to these when you want to set up another React site.
