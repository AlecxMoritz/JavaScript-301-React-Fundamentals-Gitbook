# Introduction

Think of this as your guidebook to React. We'll start by covering the basics of reacts, moving into apps to help you reinforce important topics, finish up on your main project, and also include tons of helpful resources for you to continue learning.

### To Start Gitbook: 

If you haven't installed gitbook run 
`npm install gitbook-cli -g`

Then run: 
`gitbook install`

Then run:
`gitbook serve`

### A few notes:

In the first few modules, we'll be setting up a few things just to get started. The first three modules will be a sort of blind codealong. You can refer back to these when you want to set up another React Site.
