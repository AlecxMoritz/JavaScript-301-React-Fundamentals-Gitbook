Revise the component now to do the following:

1. Keep the list in the component.
2. Underneath the list, make two components.
3. Make a functional component with a no Arrow Syntax.
4. Make another functional component using Arrow Syntax.
5. For an added bonus, make use of the reactstrap package in some unique way.
